# BTT-E3-RFF
Marlin 2.x firmware for BIGTREETECH E3 RRF board on Ender 3 with 400XL Ender Extender kit and 3.5" TFT and NO BLTOUCH

Precompiled Marlin 2.x firmware for the BIGTREETECH BTT-E3-RRF on an Ender 3 Pro with Ender Extender 400XL kit (400mm x 400mm x 500mm) with NO BLTOUCH and a BTT-TFT35-V3.0 screen (non E3 edition). You must flash the main board and then the TFT screen to complete this upgrade properly. You may get an error about BED LEVELING until you go into the settings and configure your MBL settings. Hope this helps.. I just wanted to post it because I could not find any precompiled firmware that supported this setup.
